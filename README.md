## Description:
Program which compress an image by taking that colored image as input and outputting a minimized binary string using greedy algorithm (Huffman Algorithm), which can be read back into its original colored image (however with an expected drop in resolution since we will hash pixels with similar values to the same color, thus increasing color frequency to take advantage of the Huffman Algorithm).
